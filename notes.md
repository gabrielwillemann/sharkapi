- Notes
  - Progressive framework/library for backend
  - Shark-api allow change default method for execute query
  - GraphQL with socket
- Configuration In development
  - (Required) Choice request parsed: REST API or GraphQL
  - (Required) Choice ORM: Sequelize, TypeORM or MongoDB
  - (Optional) Choice routes (index, show, create, update, destroy)
    - Attention with GraphQL
  - (Optional) Set visible or hidden fields
  - (Optional) Set custom filters
    - According to the chosen ORM
  - (Optional) Set custom sorters
  - (Optional) Set default pagination
  - (Optional) Hooks?
    - What it will work? I need to create prototype, after I'll
    - Hook by all requests, hook by entity, hook by entity and method
    - Purposes: For permissions, or tenant architecture
- Structure
  - Core
    - Load configurations
    - Start server configured
    - Intercept comunication between Server and ORM Adapters
  - Server
    - Request data to ORM Adapters
      - This comunication will intercept by core, because the library have configurations
    - Parse requests and responses
    - REST API Server
      - Create routes
      - Parameters
        - sort: Attention with custom sorts (maybe in others tables)
        - filter: Attention with custom filters (maybe with others operators)
        - page: Attention with quantity of pages (first, next, prior, last)
        - include: Attention with deep relationship
    - GraphQL Server
      - Create types, resolvers for queries and mutations
      - Attention: Joins
  - ORM Adapters
    - Is a layer that get metadata of ORM
    - Create a adapter for each ORM: Sequelize, TypeORM and MongoDB
    - All adapters will implement the same API/Interface
    - Implement all default actions (index, show, create, update and destroy) used by routes and resolvers
