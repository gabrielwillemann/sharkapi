- Notes
  - Progressive framework/library for backend
  - Shark-api allow change default method for execute query
  - GraphQL with socket
- Configuration In development
  - (Required) Choice request parsed: REST API or GraphQL
  - (Required) Choice ORM: Sequelize, TypeORM or MongoDB
  - PENDING Choice routes (index, show, create, update, destroy)
    - Attention with GraphQL
  - (Optional) Hooks?
    - Purposes:
      - OK Set custom filters
      - OK Set custom sorters
      - OK Set custom relationships
      - Set default pagination
      - Set visible or hidden fields
      - Local or global hooks
      - For permissions, or tenant architecture
- Structure
  - Core
    - Load configurations
    - Start server configured
    - Intercept comunication between Server and ORM Adapters
  - Server
    - Request data to ORM Adapters
      - This comunication will intercept by core, because the library have configurations
    - Parse requests and responses
    - REST API Server
      - Create routes
      - Parameters
        - OK sort: Attention with custom sorts, maybe in others tables
        - OK filter: Attention with custom filters (maybe with others operators)
        - OK include: Attention with deep relationship
        - PENDING page: Attention with quantity of pages (first, next, prior, last)
    - GraphQL Server
      - Create types, resolvers for queries and mutations
      - Attention: Joins

  - ORM Adapters
    - Is a layer that get metadata of ORM
    - Create a adapter for each ORM: Sequelize, TypeORM and MongoDB
    - All adapters will implement the same API/Interface
    - Implement all default actions (index, show, create, update and destroy) used by routes and resolvers
