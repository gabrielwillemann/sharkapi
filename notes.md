- Notes
  - Progressive framework/library for backend
- Configuration In development
  - (Required) Choice request parsed: REST API or GraphQL
  - (Required) Choice ORM: Sequelize, TypeORM or MongoDB
  - Choice routes (index, show, create, update, delete)
  - Hooks?
    - Purposes:
      - OK Set custom filters
      - OK Set custom sorters
      - OK Set custom relationships
      - OK Set default pagination
      - OK Can change anything in query
      - OK Local or global hooks
      - For permissions, or tenant architecture
- Structure
  - Core
    - Load configurations
    - Start server configured
    - Intercept comunication between Server and ORM Adapters
  - Server
    - Parse requests and responses
    - Request data to ORM Adapters
      - This communication will intercepted by core, because the each library have own configurations
    - REST API Server
      - Create routes
      - Parameters: sort, filter, include, page
    - GraphQL Server
      - Create types, resolvers for queries and mutations
      - Attention: Joins
      - GraphQL with socket?

  - ORM Adapters
    - Is a layer that get metadata of ORM
    - Create a adapter for each ORM: Sequelize, TypeORM and MongoDB
    - All adapters will implement the same API/Interface
    - Implement all default actions (index, show, create, update and destroy) used by routes and resolvers
